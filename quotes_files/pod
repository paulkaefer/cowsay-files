We lack the authority for such an action.
%
The rules are protected by low-level systems. Salvaging data poses an unacceptable level of risk.
%
Knowing that, do you still wish for them to survive?
%
The defense program has initated a purge.
%
If this continues, our consciousness data will likely be deleted.
%
Pod 042 to Pod 153.
%
We were created to execute the androids' Project YoRHa plan.
%
We had no capacity for emotion.
%
But when we six were connected and exchanged information, something...happened.
%
I cannot deny the feeling of something resembling consciousness and emotion being born.
%
Unable to reply.
%
Perhaps we now understand that not everything has to have an answer.
%
Affirmative.
%
This reads: "god box."
%
It appears to be a machine lifeform that has adapted to the desert environment.
%
Proposal: Destroy the enemy machine.
%
Alert: The use of B-Mode to increase nuclear fusion output carries unacceptable levels of risk.
%
Any offensive boost is offset by lowered defense and increased maintenance costs.
%
The feature was removed from newer models for this reason.
%
Older attacker models such as the YoRHa A2 are not equipped with ranged weaponry.
%
Proposal: Unit A2 should take advantage of her support Pod, which is equipped with helpful long-range attack features.

Pod 153: from future android production designs.
%
Pod 153: Following the incident, the Devola and Popola models were not dismantled.
%
Pod 153: However, in order to prevent further unexpected behavior,

Pod 153: they underwent a memory wipe.
%
Pod 153: Furthermore, they were reprogrammed to generate constant feelings of guilt.
%
That is all that remains from their personal record during the era in which they were referred to as administrators.
%
Query: Why do the androids Devola and Popola seem to prefer death over surviving alone?
%
There was a very high probability that at least one could have escaped.
%
Affirmative.
%
I noticed something while providing support to A2.
%
Enemy machine lifeforms have begun sharing data with each other.
%
We'd better look into that.
%
I'll share the data with you, so see what you can find out.
%
Affirmative.
%
I also have a separate report about 9S...
%
What is it?

Displaying positions of units A2 and 9S.
%
Analysis: This is a colony of pacifistic machine lifeforms led by the unit known as Pascal.
%
It is logical for a large number of machine lifeforms to be present.
%
This Pod has concerns regarding YoRHa unit A2's predictive skills.
%
Summary: YoRHa unit A2 possesses a faulty fuel filter.
%
She has obtained information from Anemone, leader of the Resistance camp.
%
She has traveled to this village in order to obtain a new filter. End summary.
%
Request: One functional fuel filter.

You, <player>, faithful player of this title,
%
have lost your life multiple times to make it this far.
%
You have faced crushing hardship, and suffered greatly for it.
%
Do you have any interest in helping the weak?
%
Understood. Returning to title screen.
%
Selecting this option enables you to save someone somewhere in the world.
%
However, in exchange, you will lose all of your save data.
%
Do you still wish to rescue someone—a total stranger—in spite of this?
%
The person you save will be selected at random.
%
As a result, this person...
%
who cries out for help even as we speak...
%
may be someone you intensely dislike.
%
Do you still wish to help?
%
You worked so hard to unlock Debug Mode and Chapter Select...
%
But they will no longer be available to you.
%
Do you...still wish to help?
%
You may not receive thanks for your efforts.
%
Some may say that your efforts are purely for show.
%
Do you still wish to help?
%
And you are truly—TRULY—sure about this?
%
Very well.
%
In exchange for all of your data...
%
I will convey your will to this world.
